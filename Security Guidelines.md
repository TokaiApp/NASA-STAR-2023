# **Modernized Cybersecurity Attack Methods in AI**

In the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), modern cybersecurity threats have evolved to include attacks on both integrity and confidentiality. These attacks can compromise AI systems, leading to erroneous outputs and unauthorized access to sensitive data.

## **Integrity Attacks**

Integrity attacks are deliberate attempts to cause AI models to make errors or produce incorrect results. Two popular approaches for these attacks include:

### **Data Poisoning**

In data poisoning attacks, malicious actors embed deceptive patterns into the AI's training data. These patterns are designed to mislead the machine learning model, causing it to learn incorrect patterns and skew its intended results. The goal is to manipulate the AI's behavior and compromise its integrity.

### **Evasion Attacks**

Evasion attacks focus on discovering vulnerabilities within AI models and applying subtle changes to exploit these weaknesses. Attackers aim to modify the model's output without detection. For instance, an image recognition system like MobileNetV2 was targeted in an evasion attack, causing it to misclassify an image of Georgetown University's Healy Hall as a triceratops instead of a historic building.

## **Confidentiality Attacks**

Confidentiality attacks, often referred to as model stealing techniques, aim to duplicate or steal AI training data models. If attackers can obtain or recreate these models, they gain access to proprietary or sensitive information stored within them. This stolen information can be misused or optimized for malicious purposes, such as stealing stock market prediction models or spam filtering algorithms.

Regardless of the type of attack, it is crucial for all users of AI to remain vigilant about the security challenges posed by these new technologies. Protecting AI systems against integrity and confidentiality attacks is paramount to safeguarding data and ensuring AI's reliability.

Parameterizing and validating inputs and outputs, as well as implementing strict security measures, are essential for securing LLMs (Large Language Models) when interacting with external resources. Here's a breakdown of the key points in this context:

**Parameterization and Validation:**

- **Requests to External Services:** Any requests made by the LLM to external services should be parameterized, meaning that the parameters should be carefully controlled and validated. This includes ensuring that parameters are securely injected into templates and matched against validated versions of external APIs.
- **Code Injection Routes:** Special attention should be given to potential code injection routes, such as SQL injection, Python code injection, or open redirects in search queries. Proper input validation is crucial to prevent these security risks.
- **Validation of Responses:** Values returned from external APIs should also be validated against expected contents and formats to prevent injection or unintended behaviors. This helps ensure that responses from external services are safe and reliable.

**Avoid Persisting Changes:**

- LLM requests to external APIs should avoid producing persistent changes of state whenever possible. High-risk actions like creating or dropping tables, downloading files, or writing arbitrary files to disk should be explicitly disallowed unless necessary for the service's functionality.
- If such actions are necessary, they should be isolated and executed by internal services rather than directly by the LLM. Users should only have access to specific, safe actions.

**Parameterized Interface for Persistent Changes:**

- When the main purpose of an external API is to record persistent state changes (e.g., scheduling an appointment), all updates should be parameterized and strictly validated.
- Any information recorded by the API should be linked to the requesting user, and user access to this information should be carefully controlled and authorized.

**Prefer Allow-Lists and Fail-Closed:**

- Whenever possible, external interfaces should default to denying requests, with specific permitted requests and actions placed on an allow list. This approach helps enhance security by minimizing the attack surface.
- It's safer to have a fail-closed approach where access is denied by default, and exceptions are explicitly allowed.

**Isolate Authentication Information:**

- Authentication information, such as keys, passwords, or security tokens, should be isolated from the LLM. The LLM should not have direct access to this information.
- Authentication and authorization checks should be handled by the internal API service that calls the external resource, ensuring that users are authorized to access the resource.

**Engage with Security Teams:**

- Collaborate proactively with security experts when designing interfaces between LLMs and external resources. Early involvement with security teams can help identify and address potential security risks and vulnerabilities.
- Red-teaming and thorough testing at scale are essential to validate the security of LLM interfaces.

**Adversarial Testing:**

- Adversarial testing, including red-teaming and comprehensive security testing, should be conducted to identify and address vulnerabilities in LLM applications.
- It's important to test LLMs for over-aggressive moderation, overgeneralization of canonical forms, and nondeterminism to ensure robust behavior.

By following these guidelines and best practices, organizations can enhance the security of LLM applications when interacting with external resources and reduce the risk of vulnerabilities and malicious attacks.

**Prevention:**

- Limit LLM functionality to necessary tasks.
- Implement the principle of least privilege and separation of duties.
- Log, monitor, and enforce rate limits.

**LLM09: Overreliance**

- Overreliance on LLM outputs without critical assessment can lead to misinformation, security vulnerabilities, and legal liabilities.

**Prevention:**

- Regularly monitor LLM outputs and perform fact-checking.
- Use fine-tuned models for specific domains and implement automatic validation mechanisms.

**LLM10: Model Theft**

- Unauthorized access to proprietary LLMs can lead to theft, competitive disadvantage, and data breaches.

**Prevention:**

- Implement strong access controls, network restrictions, and monitor access logs.
- Mitigate risks related to prompt injection and API rate limits.
- Incorporate adversarial robustness in LLMs.

Addressing these risks and implementing preventive measures is crucial for the secure and ethical use of Large Language Models in various applications. Organizations and developers should carefully consider these security principles and best practices when working with LLMs to ensure both their functionality and safety.

## **NASA Cybersecurity Framework Implementation**

NASA follows the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework for cybersecurity, which categorizes organizations into four Implementation Tiers based on the effectiveness of their risk management practices. These tiers are designed to evaluate the maturity of an organization's cybersecurity practices:

1. **Tier 1 - Ineffective Risk Management Methods:** Organizations in this tier have ineffective risk management practices, indicating a low level of cybersecurity readiness.
2. **Tier 2 - Informal Risk Management Methods:** Tier 2 organizations have informal risk management practices, suggesting that they are making progress but still lack structured processes.
3. **Tier 3 - Structured Risk Management Methods:** Organizations in this tier have structured risk management practices, demonstrating a higher level of maturity in cybersecurity.
4. **Tier 4 - Adaptive Risk Management Methods:** Tier 4 organizations have adaptive risk management practices, signifying the highest level of cybersecurity maturity with the ability to continually adapt to emerging threats.

**NASA Security Control Ratings**

NASA assesses its security controls based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Each security control is assigned a rating that corresponds to one of the NIST Tiers:

| Security Control | Rating | Tier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inventory and Control of Hardware Assets | Risk Informed | 2 |
| Inventory and Control of Software Assets | Risk Informed | 2 |
| Continuous Vulnerability Management | Repeatable | 3 |
| Controlled Use of Administrator Privileges | Risk Informed | 2 |
| Secure Configurations for Hardware and Software | Repeatable | 3 |
| Maintenance, Monitoring, and Analysis of Audit Logs | Repeatable | 3 |
| Malware Defenses | Repeatable | 3 |
| Boundary Defense | Risk Informed | 2 |
| Data Protection | Partial | 1 |
| Incident Response and Management | Risk Informed | 2 |

These ratings provide an assessment of how well each security control aligns with the NIST Framework and the corresponding tier indicating the level of maturity.

**Common Attack Vector Methods**

To enhance cybersecurity awareness, NASA acknowledges common attack vectors and methods that adversaries may employ. It's important to note that cyber-attacks often involve a combination of these vectors. Here are some common attack vectors:

1. **Attrition:** This attack vector involves brute force methods to compromise, degrade, or destroy systems, networks, or services. An example is a brute force attack against an authentication mechanism like passwords or digital signatures.
2. **Email:** Attackers may use email as an attack vector, sending exploit code disguised as an attached document or a link to a malicious website within an email message.
3. **External/Removable Media:** Attacks executed from removable media or peripheral devices, such as spreading malicious code from an infected USB flash drive, fall under this vector.
4. **Impersonation:** This vector includes attacks that involve replacing benign elements with malicious ones, like spoofing, man-in-the-middle attacks, rogue wireless access points, and SQL injection attacks.
5. **Improper Usage:** Any incident resulting from a user's violation of an organization's acceptable usage policies is categorized under improper usage. For instance, a user installing file-sharing software leading to data loss.
6. **Loss/Theft of Equipment:** Incidents related to the loss or theft of computing devices or media used by the organization fall into this category. Examples include lost laptops, smartphones, or authentication tokens.
7. **Web:** Attacks executed from a website or web-based application, such as cross-site scripting attacks or redirects to exploit browser vulnerabilities and install malware, are classified as web-based attack vectors.

NASA recognizes the significance of these attack vectors and takes proactive measures to mitigate potential risks associated with each vector. By understanding and addressing these vectors, NASA aims to enhance its overall cybersecurity posture and protect its critical assets and information.

This document provides an overview of NASA's approach to cybersecurity and its acknowledgment of common attack vectors, ensuring that cybersecurity remains a top priority in the organization's operations and risk management practices.
